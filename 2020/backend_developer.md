# Backend developer for Wise Home

Posted December 2020

## About Wise Home

Wise Home is a Danish tech startup from 2016.

Our product is targeted to landlords and specializes in automating manual tasks, reporting the status of buildings,
and producing distribution statements for tenants.

In June 2020 we closed our second investment.

## The job

We are looking for a backend developer to build new features and maintain the existing application.

All of our backend code is written in Elixir, but it is not important that you know Elixir or Erlang already. What we
need is a skilled backend developer who is eager to learn new stuff.

Our development team currently consists of four developers, so you will have plenty of opportunity to form your own
role based on your interests and skills.

We believe in a friendly and inclusive work environment, and that team work is more important than "rock star ninja
developers". Also, the working hours and working locations are very flexible to ensure that we can also have a family
life.

The exact job depends on you and your interests and skills. Some common development tasks could be:

* Extending and maintaining the main application with all the business logic
* Building the REST API, which is the public interface to the main application
* Writing embedded software
* Communicating with IoT devices

We offer:

* A monthly salary based on qualifications
* An exciting job in a startup with enthusiastic coworkers
* Flexible working hours

Wise Home is based in Ry, near Aarhus, Denmark. The development setup is decentralized, but the role we seek is
expected to be able to come to the office once in a while.
