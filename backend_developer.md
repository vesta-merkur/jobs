## About Wise Home

Wise Home is a Danish startup from 2016. We build smart home systems.

Our product is targeted to landlords and specializes in automating manual tasks, fulfilling legal requirements and
reporting the status of the building.

We believe that we can disrupt the Danish market by offering a better and fully automated product at a lower price.

## The job

We are looking for a backend developer to build new features and maintain the existing application.

Our stack buzzwords are Elixir, Ubuntu, PostgreSQL, Vagrant, json:api, Zigbee and Wireless M-Bus.

It is not important if you have used any of those technologies before. What we need is a skilled backend developer
who is eager to learn new stuff.

Wise Home is based in Ry, near Aarhus, Denmark. The development setup is decentralized, but the role we seek is
expected to be able to come to the office at least once every few weeks.

The exact job depends on you and your interests and skills. Some common development tasks are:

* Extending and maintaining the main application with all the business logic
* Building the REST API, which is the public interface to the main application
* Building the internal maintenance interface
* Communicating with IoT devices

## We offer

* A monthly salary based on qualifications
* An exciting job in a startup with enthusiastic coworkers
* Flexible working hours
* Education (conference trips, books, online courses, studying during work hours, etc)
